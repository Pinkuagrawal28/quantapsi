# Requirements for Optical Communication Simulation Backend

## 1. Overview

The backend will serve as the **simulation engine** for an optical communication system analysis platform. It will handle signal generation, propagation, component modeling, and performance analysis. The architecture must be modular, extensible, and performant, with a clean API interface for frontend and external tool integration.

* Batch job submission and job status monitoring.

### 2.6 Data Management

* Store input parameters, simulation results, and logs.
* Provide export to CSV/JSON for further analysis.
